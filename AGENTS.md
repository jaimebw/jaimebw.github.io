# Repository Guidelines

## Jaime Personal Website

I want to migrate from jekyll, to my own stuff. My web needs to support:
- Google Analytics
- Markdown rendering
- Latex equaitons
- Be able to load my articles already written for jekyll, and be loaded the same way
- Be able to transfer and to add pages easily

# Stack

I want you to use any framework you need to do it easy, and fast. Use bun
It needs to use the styling of the monospace-web.

# Github actions
It should have github actions implemented to auto deploy to github pages when a commit or merge it dones to the main branch

# Other stuff

You can check  the old web in web.
