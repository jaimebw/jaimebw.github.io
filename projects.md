Here you can see a couple of projecst in which I currently collaborate.
We can distingish two categories: personal and academic

## Academic projects
### Clare-db
I am currently focused on developing [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db), a free and open-source database for CFD simulations. The goal of this project is to create a platform where people can easily share and access simulations. We are utilizing Open Foam to create a robust and easily replicable software. However, we are currently facing some challenges with running parallel simulations using the Open Foam solver.

### Tacoma lib
