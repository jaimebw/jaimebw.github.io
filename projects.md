## PyArinc429
PyArinc429 is a Python library designed to simplify the encoding and decoding of ARINC 429 data in avionics systems. This library provides a straightforward interface to work with ARINC 429 words, the standard data format used in aircraft data buses.
It features tools for binary-to-engineering unit conversion, label handling, and data validation according to the ARINC 429 specification.

The library supports both encoding and decoding operations. It includes built-in support for common aviation parameters and allows custom parameter definitions. [Link](https://github.com/jaimebw/arinc429) to the repo.
# Old projects
## Clare-db
I used to work on developing [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db), a free and open-source database for CFD simulations. The goal of this project was to create a platform where people could easily share and access simulations. We utilized Open Foam to create a robust and easily replicable software. However, we faced some challenges with running parallel simulations using the Open Foam solver. [Link](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db) to the repo.

## Tacoma lib
Tacoma lib was the final result of my work at INTA. This library looked to simplify using ROM techniques with Machine Learning. It combined some cool algorithms and some abstraction of libraries such as Scikit Learn to help training models faster and easier.
