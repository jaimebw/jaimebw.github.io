Here you can see a couple of projecst in which I currently collaborate.

## Clare-db
I am currently focused on developing [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db), a free and open-source database for CFD simulations. The goal of this project is to create a platform where people can easily share and access simulations. We are utilizing Open Foam to create a robust and easily replicable software. However, we are currently facing some challenges with running parallel simulations using the Open Foam solver. [Link](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db) to the repo.

## Tacoma lib
Tacoma lib is the final result of my work at INTA. This library looks to simplify using ROM techniques with Machine Learning. It combines some cool algorithms and some abstraction of libraries such as Scikit Learn to help training models faster and easier.
