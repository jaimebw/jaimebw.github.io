Here you can see a couple of projecst in which I currently collaborate. 
We can distingish two categories: personal and academic.

## Academic projects
### Clare-db
I am currently focused on developing [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db), a free and open-source database for CFD simulations. The goal of this project is to create a platform where people can easily share and access simulations. We are utilizing Open Foam to create a robust and easily replicable software. However, we are currently facing some challenges with running parallel simulations using the Open Foam solver. [Link](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db) to the repo.

### Tacoma lib
Tacoma lib is the final result of my work at INTA. This library looks to simplify using ROM techniques with Machine Learning. It combines some cool algorithms and some abstraction of libraries such as Scikit Learn to help training models faster and easier.

## Free Time Projects
### Latex Cell Extractor
This is a small utility that helps to extract cells from Jupyter Notebooks into .tex code. I created this for my master thesis in Aerospace Engineering. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/jaimebw/jupyter_cell_extractor).
### Youtube song extractor
This is a fun utility that allows you to download and "parse" Youtube videos that contain multiple songs. I built this because I often listen to sessions on Youtube and I like to listen to them on my phone as well. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jaimebw/song_extractor).
