Hey there 👋🏻,

I'm Jaime Bowen Varela, an aerospace engineer with a passion for blending cutting-edge technology and data science. As a master's student in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnical Institute, I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible.

I'm currently in search of an internship for the summer, and if you're impressed by my profile, don't hesitate to hit me up on LinkedIn. Let's make some waves in the aerospace industry together!( My CV is available [here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf))
