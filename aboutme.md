Hey there 👋🏻,

I'm Jaime Bowen Varela. Glad you made it here. 
I have a lot of experience in different fields regarding aviation, data science, software, CFD, Machine Learning, etc...

- I'm currently based in Boston, MA, USA 📍.
- I'm working at Avidyne Corporation ✈️ developing avionics systems for aircraft and simulation software.
- If you are looking for consulting or want to ask me any questions, hit me up on LinkedIn or in X.
- My favorite plane is the [Stuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87)
- I'm passionate about computers 💻, obsessed with anything that flies ✈️, live for the thrill of motorcycles 🏍️, and get lost in the pages of vintage books 📚.
