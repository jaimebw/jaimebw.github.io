Hey there 👋🏻,

I'm Jaime Bowen Varela. Glad you make it here. 
I have a lot of experience in different fields regarding aviation, data science, software, finance, crypto finance, etc...

- I'm currently working for Avidyne Corporation building cool stuff. 
- If you are looking for consulting or want to ask me any questions, hit me up on LinkedIn or in X.
- If you want to know more about me, just know that I like computers, aircraft, motorbikes and old books.
